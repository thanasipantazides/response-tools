Telescope ARFs, RMFs, and SRMs
==============================

Throughout the `modules in the codebase <https://foxsi.github.io/response-tools/modules.html>`__ 
there are a variety of functions with names starting wtih ``asset``. 
These functions were created to mainly test the functions being written
but they might be useful to see and compare a lot of the response 
elements.

One such example is an ``asset`` function that generates a plot showing 
all of FOXSI-4's telescope ARFs, RMFs, and SRMs in one plot.

.. code-block:: Python


    import response_tools.responses as responses

Some caveats come with these asset functions as many choices that the
user can make are obviously chosen then hidden in the function but it
might still be useful to see an idea of what these elements look like:

**Note** these functions are not usually names the best since they 
were originally for testing purposes and so the names might change. 
Please utilize the `auto-generated code documentation <https://foxsi.github.io/response-tools/modules.html>`__
to keep up-to-date.

All figures produced using all of the ``asset`` functions can be found
in the codebase. The ``assets`` folder is on the same directory level 
as the ``response-information`` folder that can be found using the 
Python package global variable: ``response_tools.responseFilePath`` 
(more on the ``responseFilePath`` global variable 
`here <https://foxsi.github.io/response-tools/general_instructions.html#python-interface-to-pull-data>`__).
