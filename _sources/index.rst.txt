The FOXSI Response Tools documentation! |:fox:|
===============================================

Welcome! This is the online documentation for the `response-tools <https://github.com/foxsi/response-tools>`__ code repository developed for the `FOXSI-4 sounding rocket mission <https://foxsi.umn.edu/launches/foxsi-4>`__.

The repository contains a Python package that can help a user download FOXSI's telescope response elements. Additionally, a codebase exists to load in and work with the response files.

If you'd like to work with photon event lists from the FOXSI-4 flight, please see the `foxsi4-science-tools <https://github.com/foxsi/foxsi4-science-tools>`__ repository instead.

Documentation/help can be found in the `Response Tools Data Guide <https://github.com/foxsi/response-tools/blob/main/Response-Tools-Data-Guide-v1.pdf>`__, the top-level Github repository `README <https://github.com/foxsi/response-tools>`__, and in the `online documentation <https://foxsi.github.io/response-tools/index.html>`__.
